The AWS provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- **Static credentials**
     provider "aws" {
       region     = "us-west-2"
       access_key = "my-access-key"
       secret_key = "my-secret-key"
    }
    
- **Environment variables**
     $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="accesskey"
     $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="secretkey"
     $ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"

- **Shared credentials/configuration file**
    provider "aws" {
      region                  = "us-west-2"
      shared_credentials_file = "/Users/tf_user/.aws/creds"
      profile                 = "dev"
  }
  
  
  
  You have to create a file in the home
  [default]
  aws_access_key_id="accesskey"
  aws_secret_access_key= 
  
  [Taiwo]
  aws_access_key_id="accesskey =
  aws_secret_access_key = 
  
  In your terraform file under provider then you will pass profile and write the name of the crediential as it's in your configuration file
   provider "aws" {
      region                  = "us-west-2"
      shared_credentials_file = "/Users/tf_user/.aws/creds"
      profile                 = "dev"
